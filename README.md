# AntiqueShop
AntiquShop is a buying and selling desktop application I made it in 2018 to fullfill the requirement of visualprogramming and software engineering university class. 
I made it using C#, Visual Studio IDE and MySQL
DESKTOP-BASED ANTIQUE SHOP APPLICATION is a buying and selling desktop application that can bring buyers and sellers together so they can communicate directly. Buyers can search for available goods in accordance with goods uploaded by the seller, but both the seller and buyer must create a user first before carrying out activities in the Antique Shop. I made this application alone as requrement to fullfill Final Projects (both visual programming and software-engineering). I made it using C# Programming Language(Because C# Have a big similiarity with JAVA), MySQL Database and Visual Studio IDE as is environment. Any spesific information such as source code and more documents, can be found at Ver.1. 
You can test and start the application from WindowsFormsApplication11.exe, at Ver 2. And it doesn’t need username and password since I made it for testing purpose.
